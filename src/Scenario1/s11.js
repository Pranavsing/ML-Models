      <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
      <p>
        Visually impaired individuals face challenges in understanding the
        visual content of images. This makes it difficult for them to access
        information in a world that often relies heavily on visual
        communication.
      </p>

      <h2>Use Case: Image-to-Text Model</h2>
      <p>
        An image-to-text model can be employed to create an assistive technology
        solution. Here's how it works:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A visually impaired person uses a mobile app designed for this
          purpose.
        </li>
        <li>The user takes a picture with their smartphone camera.</li>
        <li>The image is sent to an image-to-text model.</li>
        <li>The model generates a descriptive text caption for the image.</li>
        <li>
          Text-to-speech technology converts the generated caption into audible
          feedback for the user.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Benefits</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Enables a better understanding of surroundings:</strong>{" "}
          Visually impaired individuals can gain more information about their
          environment through the generated descriptions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Improved accessibility to information:</strong> The
          image-to-text model can bridge the gap by providing access to
          information presented in visual formats like printed materials, signs,
          or other visual content.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br></br>
      <br></br>

      <div className="he">
        <h1 className="he">Content Moderation in Social Media</h1>
      </div>
      <br></br>
      <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
      <p>
        Social media platforms contend with a massive volume of user-generated
        content, making it challenging to ensure it adheres to their community
        guidelines. This includes identifying and removing inappropriate or
        offensive images that can negatively impact user experience.
      </p>

      <h2>Use Case: Image-to-Text Model for Content Moderation</h2>
      <p>
        Machine learning can be leveraged to streamline content moderation.
        Here's how an image-to-text model can be employed:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Image Analysis with Text Descriptions:</strong> The
          image-to-text model analyzes images uploaded by users and generates
          textual descriptions of their content.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Natural Language Processing (NLP):</strong> These textual
          descriptions are then processed by natural language processing (NLP)
          algorithms. NLP techniques can identify keywords, phrases, or overall
          sentiment that might indicate potentially inappropriate content.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Automated Flagging:</strong> If the generated text raises red
          flags based on the NLP analysis, the corresponding image is
          automatically flagged for further review by human moderators.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Benefits</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Efficient Workload Management:</strong> By automating the
          initial screening process, the image-to-text model helps reduce the
          burden on human moderators, allowing them to focus on complex cases
          requiring nuanced judgment.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Enhanced Content Filtering:</strong> The image-to-text model,
          combined with NLP analysis, provides a more efficient way to filter
          out inappropriate or offensive content. It can identify potential
          issues that might be missed by solely relying on image recognition
          techniques.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        It's important to note that this technology should be used as a tool to
        assist human moderators, not replace them entirely. Human expertise
        remains crucial for making final decisions and ensuring fair and
        accurate content moderation.
